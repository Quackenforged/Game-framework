# Overview

The app I created is for rolling a random number between 1 and 20 inclusive. 
This can also be changed by the user by moving the slider to a different setting in the app.

I created the app for an easy method of rolling dice virtually from a mobile device for D&D sessions.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used android studio to design the app, write the code, and test the app in a virtual android environment.

I wrote the code in Kotlin.

# Useful Websites

I used the first video to help me get android studio to run the virtual environment.
I used the second video to learn how to make a simple app in android studio.

# Future Work

* Make a slider for how many dice to roll
* Make an output for multiple rolls to be displayed simultaneously
* Add an animation to show dice as they are rolled
